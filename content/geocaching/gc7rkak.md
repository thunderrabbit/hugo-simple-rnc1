The paper did not hold up.  I have removed the cache from the system
until I can get a permanent label.  I tried finding waterproof sealant
or tape at the home center, but they did not have any that would work.

This was my first cache.  Placed on 23 June 2018, without even having a pencil inside for the log book.  Thanks to [Turbo-7](https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=fdfa20d1-f3e5-4316-beb1-69d1cebbaa3f) for helping me find English and Japanese notes to place in and on the cache.

Not sure if the paper outside the cache will survive the rain, but I did seal it with clear spray sealant.  We will see how it holds up.
